## Computer Vision Reading Groups and Tutorials, ANU-CVML
---

The CVRG and Tutorial meets weekly to discuss (mostly) recent papers in computer vision and related topics. There are also tutorial sessions, aim to introduce fundamental topics in computer vision in two/three consecutive sessions. For the reading groups, all participants are encouraged read the papers before the meeting since the presenter will only be giving an overview (15-20 minutes). The remaining time will be dedicated to the discussion of the paper, led by the presenter. For tutorials, the lecturer(s) will walk you through the main concepts, theory, and applications of the topic that will be presented.
